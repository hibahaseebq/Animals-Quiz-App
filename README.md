<bold> Animals-Quiz-App <bold>

After taking a free course on Udemy related to building a Quiz App with James Quick, I finally got to create my own Animals Quiz App.

I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Furthermore, I added a reset Highscores button to reset the high scores for those who want to start from scratch.
